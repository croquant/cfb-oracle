## Project Overview

- Django 5 application for ranking and predicting college football games.
- `core/` holds the main app:
  - models for teams, matches, venues, conferences, and Glicko ratings.
  - management commands like `cfbd_import` (ingest data) and `glicko` (calculate ratings).
  - views, admin customizations, and URLs.
- `libs/` contains shared utilities such as a Glicko-2 rating implementation and constants.
- `templates/` stores Django templates (base layout, ranking table, etc.).
- Tests reside in `tests/` mirroring the app structure.

## Development

- Python dependencies are in `requirements.txt`.
- Use `.env.example` as a reference for required environment variables.
- Linting and formatting are enforced by **Ruff** (`ruff.toml`).
- `pre-commit` runs Ruff, Django system checks, migration checks, and the test suite.

## Frontend Templates

- Use [django-cotton](https://github.com/adamghill/django-cotton) components whenever possible to keep templates consistent.
- Use [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic page interactions.
- Use [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) only when functionality cannot be achieved with pure htmx.

## Testing & Coverage

- Always use `./test.sh` to run tests and check code coverage.
- The coverage report is generated at `coverage/coverage.json`.
- Review the coverage report to ensure your changes maintain or improve test coverage.

## Pre-commit & Coverage Notes

`pre-commit` enforces formatting, linting, and coverage tracking.

1. Run `pre-commit run --files <paths>` or `git commit` to trigger the hooks.
2. If the hooks update `.coverage_total`, stage and commit that file:
   ```bash
   git add .coverage_total
   git commit -m "<your message>"
   ```
3. When `ruff format` or `ruff --fix` rewrites files, stage the changes and rerun `pre-commit` until it passes.
4. Avoid `--no-verify` except in emergencies so coverage remains in sync with the code.
